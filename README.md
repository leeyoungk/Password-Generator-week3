# Password-Generator-week3

Deployed Application:https://leeyoungk.github.io/Password-Generator-week3/ 

## Description

On week 3 of the bootcamp, this assignment was to work on generating a password on Javarscript. This was probably the most challenging assginment out of all asignments i have done so far in the bootcamp. I learned alot through out this assignment. I learned how to create variables, arrays, functions and methods. Also, one of the keything to get succeed in this assignment was to use console.log to test out every line to see if it works.

## Installation 

First, i needed to create a list of variables and their values .
And then, created a Userinut function to store all the inputs from the user.
After that, created a generatePassword function by using the inputs from the function above.
in the function, asked for all possible characters the user wanted to use in their password.
Created another function called collectRandomChars to Collect random characters one at a time.
Final, created a writePassword Function to print out a password with randomized characters.

## Usage

We can take a look at the page with password randomly printed out.
